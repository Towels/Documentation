<h1>Images</h1>
<p>This page shows a bunch of images. The file path is unknown until Angular evaluates the expression in src. With pagination we could scale the amount of shown images (index shift in array by x elements, where x is amount of images per page). <strong>ng-repeat</strong> to the rescue.</p>
<article ng-repeat="image in images">
<h4>{{image.title}}</h4>
<img src="{{image.url}}" alt="{{image.title}}" style="width: 100%; height: 0px auto"/>
<a href="{{image.url}}"><strong>Download</strong></a>
</article>
<div style="margin: 20px"></div>
<p>If we get fancy enough, we could also use lightboxes. However, I personally don't think this is really necessary considering how the content is going to accessed (through the graph) and displayed (popup, tabbed view, sidebar, split view, etc). The image is probably going to be max sized either way and surrounded by elements, so there is no need for a light/shadow - box.<p>
